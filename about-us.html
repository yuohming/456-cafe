                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            456° Café was created from the idea of turning intense challenges into cozy connections. Inspired by the spirit of Squid Game’s Players — resilience, hope, and the belief that life is sweeter when shared — 
                            our café blends drama with comfort. Instead of games of survival, we bring people together with coffee, pastries, 
                            and moments that truly matter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             456° Café was founded in 2025, It began as a small creative project that was inspired by storytelling, cinema, and, of course, coffee. 
                             We wanted to create a space that feels immersive — where the thrill of Squid Game’s world meets the warmth of a neighborhood café.
                             With bold designs, game-inspired details, and a cozy atmosphere,
                             456° Café quickly became a favorite spot for those who crave something a little different from the ordinary.

                            At 456° Café, we don’t just serve coffee — we serve experiences, connections, and a playful escape from the everyday.
